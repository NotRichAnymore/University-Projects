		<h1>What is Digital Horizons</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Digital horizons is a week organised by the employability team at NTU designed to provide 1st year Computing students with the opportunity to have an insight into the working world of computer science as well as give ideas to what employability and professional skills are needed if they want to experience that side of computer science in the future. </p>

		<h1>Meeting Computing Alumni</h1>
			<br>
		<p>The most interesting session was when I went to the Meeting computing alumni session, it was held in John Clare Lecture Theatre 6, where there was 5/6 alumni explaining there experience from the start of university to graduating to their career path after university and what they have pursued during that time. It was insightful and inspiring to hear them talk about this as it gave me an idea of what is should be doing and when (i.e placement, building up CV, University mentality) as well as purely being an interesting session.</p>

		<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
			<br>
		<p>When I arrived back at the Clifton campus, I attended another session called the Design challenge. In which, myself and 4 other 1st year students were challenged with a task to design a mobile application that would not only improve but also help maintain a healthy diet/lifestyle. My group has the idea to take from already existing ideas and work on them to use as the base to build up from. Overall whilst our group has some good ideas it was quite close to existing apps so if I was to do it again, I would try to start from scratch.</p>
